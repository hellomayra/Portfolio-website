                <h2>User Research</h2>
                
                    <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                    
                    <p>In order to better understand the current market of Expert apps, I conducted a competitive analysis of two apps: Preply and Wyzant</p>
                    
                    <h3>User Story</h3>

                    <p>To empatize with the user and from there, generate ideas that fit into the user's life</p>
                    
                    <h3>User Interviews</h3>

                    <p>For my online tutoring application I conducted interviews that helped me to understand how user think and behave with online tutoring apps and to take notes on their motivations, goals and pain points. </p>

                    <P>In addition, it was very useful for gathering more information related to seeking expert advice.</P>

                    <h3>Important Findings</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The more important the issue they want to resolve, the more likely they are to ask an expert.</li>
                        <li>Students struggle when they don't have enough exercises to practise with.</li>
                        <li>It takes a lot of time for users to find exactly what they are looking for on internet.</li>
                        <li>Users like having additional information and recommendations from the teacher.</li>
                        <li>Users feel frustrated when teachers don't take the time to explain something or when they respond with vague answers.</li>
                    </ul>		
                    
                    <h3>Personas</h3>

                    <p>Having a visual representation of my research gave me a better understanding of the needs, goals, motivations and points of frustration of my potential users. <strong>My research was humanized.</strong></p>

                    <p>My personas helped me think from a more empathetic standpoint without imposing my own beliefs and thoughts.</p>

                    <h3>User Journey</h3>

                    <p>As a next step, I created two Journey maps to analyse all the steps my Personas would have to go through to achieve their goal</p>

                    <p>Sarah. Her goal is to find another student that can explain the subject and the same time take care of her budget.</p>

                    <p>Peter. His goal is to find an expert that explains him the basics in finances, so that he can be prepared for his next meeting.</p>
                    
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Ideation</h2>
                
                <h3>User Flow</h3>
                       
                <p>To visually represent user flow and specific user Tasks.</p>

                <h3>Sitemaps</h3>
                        
                <p>I created a Sitemap based on my research, user flows and Sarah and Peter's User Journeys. Using the card Sorting method I was able to organize the information in a clear and logical way.</p>

                <p>One of the most relevant findings was that users tended to confuse "Profile" and "Settings" cards. They didn't know which one to find certain information on. For example "payment information". Taking this into account, I changed "Profile" and placed it inside "Settings" and it was much clearer in the second round of Card Sorting.</p>
                
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Prototyping</h2>

                <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                    
                <p>My wireframes were focused on three primary features: Find an expert, Chat with an expert, Book a lesson.</p>

                <h3>Style Guide</h3>
                <h3>Mockups</h3>
                <h3>Interactive Prototype</h3>
            
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>User Testing</h2>

                <h3>Usability Test Report</h3>
                    
                <p>Testing with users was of great importance not only to improve design, but also to have a better notion of the user's "common sense"- In other words, functions that may be obvious to the designer may mean something different to the end user.</p>

                <p>Another lesson was that users never use the application exactly as you expect. This means that they will find shortcuts, errors, and improvements (often by accident). As a UX Designer, it is very important to use those discovery moments and encourage participants to give feedback. This will be very helpful when designing the final prototype.</p>
